        <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
        <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

            We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
            
            Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
            Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
            Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
            Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
            Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
        </p>
        <h1>The CSS element Selector</h1>
        <p>The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.</p>
        <h1 id="idName">The CSS id Selector</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.</li>
            <li>The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!</li>
            <li>To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element</li>
        </ul>
